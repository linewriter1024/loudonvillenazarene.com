        <h2>Our Beliefs</h2>
        <p><strong>We Believe...</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In one God, The Creator of all things, who reveals himself as
            Father, Son and Spirit.
          </li>
          <li>
            In Jesus Christ, who is fully God and fully man at the same time,
            who became like us to bring about our salvation.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the Holy Spirit, who is active in the world, bringing us to
            salvation.
          </li>
          <li>
            That the Bible is the Word of God, giving us all we need to know
            about how to be saved.
          </li>
          <li>
            That we are all sinners by both nature and actions and need God's
            forgiveness and cleansing.
          </li>
          <li>
            That Jesus Christ died on the cross and that, but trusting in His
            death, we can be restored to a right relation to God and that He
            rose from the dead and ascended into heaven to prepare a place for
            us.
          </li>
          <li>
            That God has enabled us to turn to Him from sin but that He has not
            forced us to do so.
          </li>
          <li>
            That each person must repent, turn away from his sins, and trust
            Christ by faith to accept Him.
          </li>
          <li>
            That when we turn from sin and trust in Christ, the old record of
            sin is wiped clean, and we are born anew, thus becoming part of the
            family of God.
          </li>
          <li>
            That after being born anew, we need the fullness of God's Spirit in
            our hearts. When we make a complete commitment to Him, He cleanses
            our spirit, fills us with His Spirit and perfect love, and gives us
            the power to live victoriously.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the Church, the community that confesses Jesus Christ as Lord,
            the covenant people of God made new in Christ, the Body of Christ
            called together by the Holy Spirit through the Word.
          </li>
          <li>In baptism and urge people to be baptized as Christians.</li>
          <li>In the Lord's Supper.</li>
          <li>
            God can heal. We pray for healing. We also believe that God can work
            through medical science.
          </li>
          <li>That Christ is coming again.</li>
          <li>
            That everyone shall face the judgment of God with its rewards and
            punishments.
          </li>

                time with friends. As a family, they try to make the most of
                every day and choose joy no matter the circumstances.
