          <h2>Vacation Bible School</h2>
          <p>
            Each summer our church holds VBS for children from pre-school through
            elementary school. The average attendance in the last few years has
            been approximately 50 children and volunteers. At VBS children will
            learn upbeat songs about God, scripture verses and Bible Stories that
            they can apply to their lives. A snack is provided. Recreation is also
            part of each session. For questions please call the church office at
            419-994-3690.
