            The Store is a clothing ministry of LCW (Loudonville Church Women) to
            the villages of Loudonville and Perrysville. The Free Store is housed
            in the downstairs area of our church building. This ministry is shared
            with eight other churches in the Loudonville-Perrysville area. The
            Free Store has existed as a vital and necessary ministry in
            Loudonville for over 30 years. Free clothing is available to anyone
            that lives in the Loudonville-Perrysville School District. The Free
            Store is staffed by faithful committed volunteers who have been
            serving for many years. Children, youth and adult clothing is
            available along with small household items, books, and toys. (No
            furniture) The Store is open every Tuesday from Noon to 3:00 p.m.
            Donations can be dropped off on Mondays and Wednesdays 9:30 a.m.-Noon
            or placed in the big brown plastic box by The Store door anytime, or
            drop offs can be arranged by calling 419-994-3690.
